    # Note times are in UTC, which is 1 or 2 hours behind CET depending on daylight savings.

    # Currently, we aim to trigger ingest every day at 14:07 UTC which is 15:07 CET (as of Nov 2021).
    # Note the actual runs might be late. As of right now, the action starts only around 14:22 UTC.
    # Numerous people were confused, about that, including me:

    # Note, '*' is a special character in YAML, so you have to quote this string.

    # Looks like you are about to modify this schedule? Make sure you also modify the schedule for the
    # sister GISAID job, so that we don't need to keep two schedules in our heads.
