"""
Download all SARS-CoV-2 sequences and their curated metadata from GenBank via
NCBI Virus.

Outputs newline-delimited JSON records.

The request this program makes is based on observing the network activity that

    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202,%20taxid:2697049

performs after clicking through the download interface.  Some tweaks were made
by comparing different download requests and guessing, which allows us to
download the metadata + sequence in the same request instead of two.

See also the full set of fields available in an example record saved to:

    docs/ncbi-virus-all-fields-example.json

which was extracted from network observations during load of the above NCBI
Virus URL.
