# This image, nextstrain/ncov-ingest, is used to run the ncov-ingest pipelines
# on AWS Batch via the `nextstrain build --aws-batch` infrastructure.
#
# The additional dependencies of ncov-ingest are layered atop a version of the
# nextstrain/base image.  In the future, `nextstrain build` could (and should)
# automatically satisfy the additional dependencies of a build (e.g. with
# integrated Buildpacks and/or Conda support; there are pros and cons for each
# system).
#
# The image is updated and published automatically by a GitHub Actions
# workflow.  To rebuild the image manually on your local computer, run:
#
#     docker build -t nextstrain/ncov-ingest:latest .
#
# Publish to Docker Hub with:
#
#     docker image push nextstrain/ncov-ingest:latest
#
# The automatic ingest runs always use the "latest" tag.
#
# Note that this image is only intended to provide the *dependencies* of
# ncov-ingest's pipelines, not the actual programs and pipelines of
# ncov-ingest themselves.  This means the image only needs to be updated when
# dependencies change, not when any pipeline change is made, and thus image
# updates can be far less frequent.

# XXX TODO: This can be updated to :latest eventually when the python-base
# version becomes the new default, if this ncov-ingest image itself is still
# relevant at that time.
